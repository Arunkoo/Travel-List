# Travellist

Travellist is a React application built with Tailwind CSS and Vite that helps you keep track of items for your travels. It provides a convenient form to input the quantity and name of items you need to pack. Once added, the items are displayed in a list where you can manage them efficiently.

## Features

- **Add Items:** Easily add items to your packing list by providing the quantity and name.
- **Delete or Mark as Checked:** Each item in the list can be deleted or marked as checked. Checked items are visually indicated with a strike-through effect.
- **Clear All:** Clear the entire list with a single click.
- **Sort Items:** Sort items based on completion status or alphabetically.
- **Stat Bar:** A stat bar displays how many items you've packed compared to the total, along with a percentage of empty space.
